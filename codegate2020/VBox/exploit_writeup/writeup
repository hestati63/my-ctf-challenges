The program converts guest virtual addresses to host virtual addresses to handle
the buffer. For that, it reads all corresponding pte entries for buffer in
4K granularity and checks whether the entry contains valid guest physical address.
After that, it refetches the guest physical address from the pte entry. But if
the system call overwrites the prefetched entries, it leads OOB write on mmaped
heap.

Exploit is quite straight forward. Using the oob, partially overwrite the clean
up logic, `__elf_set___libc_atexit_element__IO_cleanup__` to `system` (it
requires 1.5 bytes bruteforce.) Also, it's first argument also lied in
libgcc. It is possible because the distance between mmap chunk and libc is
always same.
